This repository contains my two portfolio projects.

project1 is a Gazetteer, which is meant to display data retrieved from various free APIs regarding a country provided from the selected list. It extracts a list of countries and their ISO codes from an internal geoJSON file, which is then embedded into an HTML <select> tag as its individual options to choose from.
  
It then retrieves information from the internal geoJSON files to render selected country's borders on the map, and sends requests to various APIs to retrieve data such as local news, weather and basic information about the country.
